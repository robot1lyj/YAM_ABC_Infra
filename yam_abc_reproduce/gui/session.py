"""CollectSession: the one stateful live object behind the Collect tab.

Owns the ControlLoop, the EpisodeRecorder, and the CameraHub, and implements the
continuous-loop + sync-gate model:

  * "Go live" (first Start Teleop): apply the edited config, bring the CAN buses
    up (hardware), build the devices, start the loop, and enable sync.
  * Once live, the loop runs continuously so the teaching-handle buttons stay
    readable. The **top button** and the GUI toggle both flip ``sync_enabled``
    (follower mirrors or not); the **second button** and the GUI toggle both
    start/stop recording. State is reported via ``status()`` so the GUI mirrors
    the hardware buttons and vice versa.

Hardware isn't touched until go-live, so the operator can edit the Station rail
first. The mock path has no CAN/buttons — sync/record are GUI-driven only.
